# EC327Project
Project for EC327 

To run the game, press the hammer (build) button and make sure the elephant button (sync to gradle) gets pressed. Then, press the run button 
and select your Android device of choice to emulate the game. Once the game loads onto the virtual device, the gameplay can be initiated by tapping the bird.

This project involved the use of libGDX, an open-source game development framework, which allowed for a more streamlined process when building the game.   
The repository for the libGDX framework can be found here: https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx.github.io
